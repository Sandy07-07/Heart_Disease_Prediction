This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive analysis and predictive model for heart disease based on a dataset containing 13 columns with values related to various aspects of heart health. 
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

The dataset used in this project comprises 13 columns, each representing different attributes related to heart health. 
These attributes include factors such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. 
The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure its quality and relevance to the task of heart disease prediction.

The repository includes a detailed analysis of the dataset, exploring key insights and trends related to heart disease. 
Descriptive statistics, data visualizations, and correlation analyses are provided to give a clear understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

The heart disease prediction model is built using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. 
The model takes into account the various features from the dataset and is trained to accurately predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease. 

The dataset can also be downloaded from Kaggle :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
